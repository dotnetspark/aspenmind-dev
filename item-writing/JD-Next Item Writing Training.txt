Construct
-----------------
- Construct is the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) we intend to measure in an assessment (test).
- Construct-Relevant: That which is required or important to measuring the construct. 
- Construct-Irrelevant Variance: That which is extraneous to what is being measured and can reduce the accuracy of measurement.

Important:
We want to isolate the construct as much as possible and avoid introducing construct-irrelevant variance. For example, if we want to measure someone’s math skills, we want to avoid introducing unnecessary reading load and complex vocabulary that could be inadvertently measuring their reading ability.

This is the foundational question you must always ask yourself,
- Is this really what I am trying to measure with this item?
- Is there anything about this item that could introduce construct-irrelevant variance?
- It’s really a balancing act. We cannot take away the fact that we have to use language to measure understanding and analytical skills, but we can think deeply about the language we use to measure these skills and try to reduce construct-irrelevant variance.

Examples of construct-irrelevant variance: extraneous or distracting test material; irregular test administrations. What we want to reduce is the construct-irrelevant variance we have control over. We are not always going to be able to think of every single thing. 


Construct Validity, Reliability and Fair
-------------------------------------------
- Validity: How accurately a test measures the construct.
- Reliability: How consistently the test measures the construct.
- Fair: How the test allows all test takers (regardless of background) to showcase their KSAs. 
- Fair DOES NOT mean everyone performs equally well! On the contrary, we want the test to “discriminate” statistically between less and more able test takers!

How do we make JD-Next valid, reliable, and fair?
- Align to topics/evidence statements
- Follow item-writing best practices
- Are varied and interesting, but do not introduce unnecessary construct-irrelevant variance
- Allow capable test-takers to showcase their abilities

What are we measuring?
----------------------
Measuring test-takers’:
Understanding of legal topics studied during the JD-Next course
Ability to analyze a hypothetical fact pattern or scenario and apply their knowledge of specific legal principles and methods to derive an answer
Ability to structure and craft a written response in the FIRAC format

How are we measuring?
---------------------
~100 single-select multiple-choice items and 1 writing prompt
Using hypothetical scenarios/fact patterns that demonstrate principles learned during the course
On 15 course topic areas with supporting evidence statements 
Through items of varying difficulty (easy, medium, difficult)*

* We can only truly determine how difficult an item is once it has been administered. However, we can do our best to create variety through using item-writing best practices.

Item Writing DO
-------------------
- Measure the right KSAs and important aspects of the construct, not trivial details.
- Pay attention to not only what is being measured, but the cognitive processing required by the test taker to respond to the item.
- Write items that can be reasonably answered within the time constraints.
- Items should clearly align to topic content taught in the course and map to an evidence statement.
- Write items that test different angles or evidence statements.
- Items should be completely independent from one another—no overlap, cueing, or “lockstepping.”
- Should be varied, but universally relatable and comprehensible to all US test takers. 

Item Writing DO NOT
-------------------
- Avoid writing items that can be answered with common sense or outside knowledge.
- Do not waste items on a trivial aspects, small exceptions to rules, or aspects not worth testing.
- Do not be tricky or set traps that might trick a capable test taker into selecting the wrong answer.
- Do not have an answer be wrong due to a very unimportant detail.
- Do not provide clues that would help a test taker answer another item in the same form (cluing or cueing).
- Avoid big variations in length for similar item types.
- Avoid “cloning” items—items should be varied enough they can be put on the same form without overlap.

Language DO
------------
- Use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
- Clear, simple language (“plain English”) is best.
- Use “legalese” only when it’s necessary for construct reasons.
- Names should represent a balance of gender and ethnicity with common spellings (no creative spelling or punctuation).
- Word choice should always be as simple, clear, and as unambiguous as possible.

Language DO NOT
-----------------
- Avoid embellishment or complexity for its own sake.
- Avoid illogical statements.
- Do not use regional language, slang, or concepts that are only applicable to one region of the US.
- Avoid vague and ambiguous words such as “seldom,” “frequently,” “occasionally,” “moderately,” “somewhat” or specific determiners such as “never” or “always.”
- Do not sacrifice clarity in an effort to reduce word count.

Stimulus DO's
-------------
- Be clearly written and easy to read (difficulty should be driven by the complexity of the thought-processing required to analyze and apply the legal principles, rather than the language used to describe the scenario). Use short and simple sentences for clarity. Use simple vocabulary for everything except specialized terms required for construct reasons
- Provide enough context and information for the test taker to be able to key the item and provide fodder for “attractive distractors”
- Writing the stimulus is a balancing act between being accessible to all test takers (potential pitfall: too common or repetitive) and providing an interesting variety of contexts (potential pitfall: fairness issues)
Bottom Line: We need variation within and across the test forms!

Stimulus DON'Ts
---------------
- Gruesome or potentially upsetting scenarios (e.g., death, diseases, surgery)
- Controversial topics (e.g., drugs, abortion, immigration)
- Content that will be dated or quickly obsolete (e.g., references to specific technology or software)
- Situations that might be typically more relatable to one gender over another (e.g., getting your nails done at the salon)
- Repetition of the same scenario or details across items (e.g., web development)
- Humorous, outlandish, or implausible scenarios that could be distracting to test takers
- Stereotyping of groups of people (e.g., male lawyers, Hispanic landscapers, etc.). 
- Situations that require outside or specialized knowledge to understand. 
- Contexts with luxury or unnecessary displays of wealth (e.g., traveling on a yacht or skiing at a lodge).

STEM
----
- Should be clear and easy to read
- Should be a direct question that is structured in such a way that a learner could answer it without seeing the options
- Should be worded positively. Avoid negative stems with words like “NOT,” “LEAST,” “EXCEPT.”
- Should not contain irrelevant or superfluous information

KEY
------
- Must be the single best answer and the ONLY correct answer
- Should be similar in length and parallel in structure to the distractors 
- Should not be a direct copy of language from the stem or the stimulus
- The key should not stand out because it is noticeably longer or shorter than the other choices, noticeably more or less detailed, noticeably more or less technical, and so forth. 

DISTRACTORS
--------------
- Attractive and plausible to people who do not know the right answer, but not divert able test takers from the key
- Solidly incorrect based on the stimulus and the stem, but relevant to the stimulant and the stem
- Comparable to the other options in form and difficulty
- Similar in length and parallel in syntax
- Mutually exclusive from one another
- If possible, based on common misunderstandings or misconceptions

RATIONALE
-----------
- Each key should have a rationale or “reason” why it is correct. If you have a hard time writing the rationale, then the key (or item) is probably not solid.

Item Style Notes
----------------
- JD-Next does not use “None of the Above” or “All of the Above” or “A and B” or “Only A” types of options.
- If options start with “Yes” or “No,” it’s best to have two of each so they are parallel.
- Full sentences have a period at the end, sentence fragments do not.
- Avoid negative stems (those containing words like “NOT,” “LEAST,” “EXCEPT.”
- All items have 4 options, except for FIRAC items, which always have five options in the same order (Facts, Issues, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion).
- Key position should vary randomly (avoid key runs such as all Cs or all As or fixed patterns).
- Topics such as “expectation damages” should be lower case within the stem; if within the options, only the first word should be capitalized when it appears at the beginning of the  options. 
- Not all items should have personal names in them—try to use a mixture of fictitious business names, personal names where it helps clarify, and generic terms such as “a couple” or “an employee.” 

ISSUES EXAMPLES
----------------

Stimulus Examples Yay or Nay
---------------------------

Example 1:
Laura was very unhappy with the appearance of her hips, which appeared lumpy in stretch pants. She went to Dr. Payton, a plastic surgeon, for a consultation to fix her “hip dips.” Dr. Payton offered to perform liposuction for $4,000. The doctor promised Laura that she would be 100% happy with her hips after the procedure. Laura scheduled the procedure, paying Dr. Payton a non-refundable deposit. Dr. Payton performed the liposuction, and Laura paid the rest of the sum owed to Dr. Payton. Laura was initially thrilled with the results of her liposuction, but six months later, Laura notices her right hip is one inch larger than her left hip and complains to Dr. Payton. He claims that he fulfilled his end of the bargain and that the contract clearly states that liposuction results may vary.

What damages can Laura claim?

Issue: Totally inappropriate context. Some extraneous details, but not that many.

Example 2:
An employee eats shredded paper at his desk every day for lunch. His employer promises him a $500 bonus if he stops eating shredded paper for a period of one month. The employee agrees to stop eating shredded paper but starts smoking marijuana at his desk instead. The employer refuses to pay the bonus at the end of the month. 

Is this agreement enforceable based on consideration?

Example 3:
Matt and Jose, two college friends, decide they want to travel to Tanzania to hunt large game on their spring break. Jose books the $5,000 non-refundable airline tickets on his credit card and Matt promises to give Jose $2,500 when his parents give him his birthday money the following month. Several months go by and Matt still has not given Jose the money. When Jose asks Matt for his share of the airfare, Matt claims the agreement was not in writing and states he does not intend to give Jose the $2,500 after all. 

Is this agreement enforceable based on consideration?

Identify the Issue Examples
----------------------------
Example 1:
A company tells a contractor, "We might hire you for projects as they come up, paying you a competitive rate for each." The contractor agrees. Is the contractor's promise enforceable?
A. Yes, because the company has promised potential work.
B. Yes, because the contractor has agreed to the terms.
C. No, because the company's promise does not obligate them to provide any work.
D. No, because the contractor's agreement is based on uncertain future work.

Topic: Insufficient Illusory Promise
Issue: Stem asks about contractor, but key is about the company. If you read the stem properly, actually D would be the key. 

Example 2:
A business emails a supplier, "We will buy 1000 units of your product at the list price of $1.25 each if you can deliver by next month." The supplier replies, "Thank you, we will do our best to meet your deadline." The supplier fails to deliver on time. 
Based on Objective Theory, which of the following is correct?

A. The supplier's response is considered acceptance, creating a binding contract.
B. There is no contract because the supplier's response did not definitively accept the offer.
C. The business cannot enforce the contract because the terms were not specific enough.
D. The supplier is bound to the contract because an email qualifies as a written agreement.

Topic: Objective Theory
Issue: This example doesn’t represent objective theory as it is presented in the course.  The terms not being specific enough are listed as illusory promise.

Example 3:
A neighbor promises to gift another neighbor her old bicycle if the latter helps her move to a new house. The neighbor helps with the move, but the bicycle is not given. Is the promise enforceable?

A. Yes, because helping to move is a considerable effort.
B. Yes, because the promise to help the neighbor move was a gratuitous one.
C. Yes, because the neighbor made a solemn promise to gift the bicycle.
D. Yes, because the helping neighbor had no legal duty to help her neighbor move.

Topic: Gratuitous Promise
Issue: Language is confusing with no names.

Example 4:
In a situation where a carpenter is promised future employment on a big project by a construction company, and in anticipation, the carpenter purchases new tools and equipment, but the company later decides to hire someone else, which element of promissory estoppel will be important for the carpenter to prove? 

A. The construction company should have reasonably expected the carpenter to undertake detrimental action or forbearance based on their promise. 
B. That the promise was in writing 
C. The carpenter provided consideration for the promise. 
D. The promise was made in a commercial context. 

Topic: Promissory Estoppel
Issue: Run on sentence; generic context. Option (key) much longer; options are mismatched in length. Three of them are full sentences, one of them is a fragment.

Example 5:
A musician tells a friend that she will gift him a rare guitar if he teaches her how to play a specific song. The friend spends several weeks teaching the musician the song, but once learned, the musician decides not to gift the guitar. Can the friend legally claim the guitar?

A. Yes, because he spent time teaching the musician.
B. No, because the promise was gratuitous and lacked consideration.
C. Yes, because he taught the song in exchange for the promise of the rare guitar.
D. No, because the friend enjoyed teaching the song.

Topic: Gratuitous Promise
Issue: Rewrite—this whole scenario is confusing. Why is the friend teaching the musician how to play a song on the musician’s rare guitar? Lack of names is also confounding things. Also, Option A is keyable and overlaps with Option C.

Example 6:
A business owner tells a marketing consultant, "Improve our online presence, and if it results in increased sales, I'll consider hiring you for a larger project." The consultant agrees and fulfills the task. The business owner acknowledges the improvement but decides not to hire the consultant for further work. Is the consultant entitled to the larger project?

A. The consultant is entitled because they fulfilled their part of the agreement.
B. The consultant is not entitled because the business owner's promise was illusory.
C. The consultant is entitled because the business owner acknowledged the improvement.
D. The consultant is not entitled because the business owner considered but did not promise the larger project.

Topic: Illusory Promise
Issue: Option D is keyable.  It’s the only option that has the specific legal term in it. The reason the promise is illusory is because the business owner said he would consider it, which is vague. Secure the key better with suggested revisions to B and D.

Example 7:
A homeowner promises a neighbor to share their high-speed internet if the neighbor agrees to water the homeowner's plants while they are on vacation. The neighbor agrees and performs the task. Is this agreement enforceable based on consideration?
	
A. Yes, because the neighbor has provided a service by watering the plants.
B. No, because sharing internet access does not constitute something of legal value.
C. Yes, because both parties have exchanged promises that have legal value.
D. No, because the task of watering plants is considered trivial.

Topic:
Issue: This one strikes me as tricky because it's not clear whether sharing "high-speed internet" with your neighbor is automatically legal. It might violate terms and agreements of the service provider. We don’t know whether the high speed internet sharing is the neighbor splicing a cable or merely sharing a Wi-Fi password. Also, Option A is technically true. Option B could be keyable if sharing high-speed internet is not legal. 

Example 8:
A tenant fixes a leak in the rental property without being asked or promised compensation by the landlord. After the repair, the landlord promises to deduct the cost of repair from the next month's rent. Is this promise enforceable?

A. No
B. Yes, because fixing a leak is the responsibility of the landlord.
C. Yes, because the tenant fixed the leak.
D. Yes, as a matter of equity.

Topic:
Issue: In some states tenants who perform maintenance because the landlord refuses or doesn't take care of it do have the right to deduct from their rent if it’s a habitability issue. I would avoid this context because tenant law is so variable and anyone who knows anything about tenant law might get this wrong. 

Example 9:
A teacher promises to give their student an extra credit point if the student brings coffee to class for the teacher every day for a week. The student agrees and fulfills the request. This is an example of:

A. Insufficient consideration.
B. Past consideration.
C. Adequate consideration.
D. A gratuitous promise.

Topic:
Issue: This scenario seems very dubious. I cannot see how a teacher could trade extra credit for a coffee (it’s seems unethical/a violation of some rule).  In addition, when I read the open stem on this question, I couldn’t answer it without seeing the options (and due to the dubious context, I was at a loss how to answer it). 

Item Revision Assignment
---------------------------
Current Issues:
- Items are too “bare bones” and contexts are repetitive.
- Contexts are often insufficient to make nuanced distinctions.
- Items are not accurately aligned to topics.
- Items are often too easy—we need a range of item difficulty.
- Items have some language and consistency issues. 
- Keys are not always “secure.”
- Distractors are “unattractive.” 

Item Revision To-Do:
- Add sufficient context to stimulus for variety and to allow test takers to think more deeply.
- Align items to topics and evidence statements to ensure accuracy.
- Ensure item is written following best practices including:
- Clear language
- One defensible key
- Fair and accessible context
- Free of errors

Before and After Example 1
BEFORE:
A publishing company contracts with an author for the delivery of a manuscript by a certain date. The author fails to deliver the manuscript on time, affecting the publishing schedule. What compensation can the publishing company seek? 

A. Damages for the delay, including any lost profits from the delayed publication. 
B. A new deadline for manuscript delivery with no additional compensation. 
C. Only a refund of any advance payment made to the author. 
D. Punitive damages for breach of contract. 

AFTER:
Astro Publishing contracts with an author to write a novel. The novel is scheduled to be published in time to sell at a popular science fiction convention. Astro Publishing agrees to pay the author an advance payment for the manuscript plus future royalties from sales of the novel. The author fails to deliver the manuscript of the novel by the deadline, delaying the publishing schedule. Astro Publishing loses the opportunity to sell the novel at the convention.  

What compensation is Astro Publishing entitled to? 

A. Damages for the lost profits from the convention 
B. A reduction in the author’s future royalties  
C. A partial refund of the advance payment made to the author 
D. Expenses Astro Publishing incurred for attending the convention

Before and After Example 2
BEFORE:

Paula Prospecter, who is a destitute claimant to an Alaskan gold mine, promises to pay Fran Financier $10,000 if Paula succeeds in reclaiming her mine, in return for Fran Financier's payment of $50 to help Paula to go to Alaska and try.

Is there consideration here?

AFTER:
Paula Prospector, who is a destitute claimant to an Alaskan gold mine, promises to pay Fran Financier $10,000 if Paula succeeds in reclaiming her mine. Fran agrees to pay Paula $50 to help Paula go to Alaska to try to reclaim her mine. They both sign an agreement stating that Paula will pay Fran $10,000 once she has reclaimed her mine. Fran gives Paula the $50 and Paula goes to Alaska. 

A month later, Paula returns from Alaska having successfully reclaimed her mine. She decides to pay Fran $1,000 and no more, since Fran only gave her $50 and it does not seem fair that $50 should be worth $10,000. Fran refuses to accept the $1,000 and decides to sue Paula for $10,000.

Does Fran have a defensible reason to sue Paula?

A. Yes, because Paula broke her promise to share ownership of the mine with Fran.
B. Yes, because Paula and Fran negotiated terms and signed an agreement. 
C. No, because Fran paid Paula a nominal amount of money in exchange for a larger sum of money.
D. No, because Fran took advantage of Paula’s poor financial situation.

In the before, there is not enough context to determine whether there is consideration. In the course, you have the luxury of thinking about your argument and filling in the gaps. In the exam, there needs to be enough context in order to properly secure the key.
